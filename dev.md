A small selection of things I've written. The most recent up-to-date

--------

[pimpd2](/dev/pimpd2/)

An mpd client written in Perl, take two. A huge list of features, including:

* An interactive shell!
* Interact with database and playlist using regular expressions
* Randomize a new playlist with random songs from the database
* Copy the current song/album to $destination
